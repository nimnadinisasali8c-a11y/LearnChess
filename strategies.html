<ol>
    <li>
        <h4>Control the Centre</h4>
        <p>Controlling the central squares of the board allows your pieces to move more freely and gives you greater influence over the game.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Develop Your Pieces Early</h4>
       <p>Bringing your knights and bishops into active positions early helps prepare your pieces for both attack and defence.</p>
    </li>    
    <li>
        <h4>Protect Your King</h4>
       <p>Keeping your king safe is essential. Castling early in the game is a common way to protect the king and connect your rooks</p>
    </li>    
    <li><h4>Avoid Moving the Same Piece Repeatedly</h4>
       <p>Try to develop different pieces instead of moving one piece multiple times during the opening phase</p>
    </li>
